# Disneyland-Resort-Reviews-Report
This report is like the weekly report done in my Data Analyst job at The Disneyland Resort. The weekly report updates resort management, executives, and vice presidents from all lines of business of overall and drill downed trends for the week. It informs these leaders of which offerings went well and what needs to be improved.
